    "Some solvers allow you to customize aspects of the solve process in a deeper way than just setting options for these parameters. You can provide code to be run when certain events happen, and the solver **calls back** to these functions to ask what action(s) should be taken. Why might you want to do this? Some situations:\n",

    "## Modelling using Lazy Constraints\n",
    "see http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/0.15/callbacks.html#lazy-constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "**Question**: Now suppose we wish to solve the sparse linear regression problem, but as a sequence of mixed integer linear programs, rather than a single mixed integer quadratic program. How might we go about doing so?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: ![](outerapprox.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What are potential problems we might run into, if we wish to implement this in JuMP?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Lazy constraints are useful when the full set of constraints is too large to explicitly include in the initial formulation. We might want to modify the MIP solution process such that when we have a new solution (for example with a heuristic or by solving a problem at a node in the branch-and-bound tree), we are given the opportunity to generate additional constraint(s). This allows us to generate them only upon demand, and stop the process based on our termination criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, we can view it as a \"linearization\" of some (often convex) function, where you perform a succession of \"outer-approximations\" that converges towards the underlying function you wish to work with. There are three important steps to providing a lazy constraint callback:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we must write a function that will analyze the current solution that takes a single argument, e.g. `mylazycongenerator(cb)`, where cb is a reference to the callback management code inside JuMP.\n",
    "2. do whatever analysis of the solution you need to inside your function to generate the new constraint before adding it to the model with `@lazyconstraint(cb, myconstraint)` (instead of the usual `@constraint(m, myconstraint)`).\n",
    "3. finally we notify JuMP that this function should be used for lazy constraint generation using the `addlazycallback(m, mylazycongenerator)` function before we call `solve(m)`."
